Project 2- Top 10
Peer Reviewed by: Alexander Soria
Peer review notes: The pages fit in both the standard 1920 x 1080 format, as well as the iPad format, say for an offset regarding the menu background on top. I really liked how you guys implemented the carousel, and I like that there's a button to see how these games worked via a button added to the top right. I feel that the font could have been bigger and perhaps each slide could have had more, as the standard 1920 x 1080 size offers much more space to be included. Overall, great work!
